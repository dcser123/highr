This is an infrastructure R package for syntax highlighting. It supports
LaTeX and HTML output. Not surprisingly, it works best with R code. It
attaches markups onto source code, e.g., it turns

```r
a <- 1 # something
```

into LaTeX code

```latex
\hldef{a} \hlkwb{<-} \hlnum{1} \hlcom{\# something}
```

or HTML code

```html
<span class="hl std">a</span> <span class="hl kwb">&lt;-</span> <span class="hl num">1</span> <span class="hl com"># something</span>
```

via

```r
library(highr)
hi_latex("a <- 1 # something")
hi_html("a <- 1 # something")
# or hilight(code, format = "latex"/"html")
```

This package also has a wrapper function, `hi_andre()`, for Andre Simon's
[Highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de) package.

There are a few package Markdown vignettes in this package:

```r
browseVignettes(package = "highr")
```

To install the development version here, use

```r
install.packages('highr', repos = 'https://yihui.r-universe.dev')
```

This package is licensed under GPL, and was originally designed for serving other packages
such as [**knitr**](http://yihui.org/knitr/).
